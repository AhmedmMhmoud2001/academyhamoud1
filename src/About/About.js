                Madrasa is a leading e-learning platform that provides exeptional Arabic 
                language educational content for all subjects like science and mathematics 
                and that is available for free for more than 50 million Arab students wherever
                they are. Madrasa is part of the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives
                (MBRGI), providing more than 5,000 educational videos. These videos display content
                focused on physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and general science, covering various 
                educational curricula and targeting all levels of students from kindergarten to grade 12. In
                addition, Madrasa offers exercises and applications of different scientific syllabus, taking your 
                learning to a new level. Those educational videos were created and produced in line with world-class 
                curricula and as part of a localization plan that takes into consideration the educational needs of students 
                throughout the different educational stages. Furthermore, Madrasa follows the highest technical standards and 
                controls when it comes to selecting and localizing scientific content aligned with curricula approved in the
                Arab World through the Translation Challenge. The Translation Challenge is the largest scientific
                translation project launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Launched in September
                2017, this project aimed at translating and localizing outstanding educational content for Arab students.
                This project was executed by hundreds of Arab translator volunteers, scientific editors, narrators, 
                graphic designers, technical producers, and teachers under the supervision of specialized educational
                and technical committees. Through spreading education and knowledge, Madrasa is part of MBRGI; the
                region’s largest foundation dedicated for making hope and building a better future for humanity. It 
                is perhaps worth mentioning that spreading education and knowledge is one of MBRGI’s main pillars. The
                objectives of these pillars are realized through executing programs, projects and sustainable
                initiatives to develop the educational, cognitive and cultural ecosystem in the Arab region,
                improve the quality of education in disadvantaged communities around the world, and facilitate
                access to it, especially in areas facing major challenges and constraints.
